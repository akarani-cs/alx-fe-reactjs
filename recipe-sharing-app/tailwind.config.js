// This is a Tailwind CSS configuration file that sets up the content paths for Tailwind to scan for class names.
// It also extends the default theme and includes no additional plugins.
// The `content` array specifies where Tailwind should look for class names to generate styles.
// The `theme` object allows for customization of the default Tailwind theme.
// The `plugins` array is empty, indicating no additional plugins are being used.
// This configuration is typically used in a React project to style components using Tailwind CSS.
// Make sure to run `npx tailwindcss init` to create this file if it doesn't exist yet.
// You can also customize the `theme` object to add your own styles or modify existing ones.
// For example, you can add custom colors, fonts, or spacing values to the `extend` object within the `theme`.
// To use Tailwind CSS in your project, ensure you`ve installed the necessary dependencies and set up your build process to include Tailwind's styles.
